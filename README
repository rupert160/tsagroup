Hello Louiza and Laurie,

Please see attached the coding assignment for the interview on the 19th of July 2024

Pre requisites:
A linux CLI environment with `podman`, `podman-compose` and `curl`

Running project:
execute ./doit.sh

to pull the image down from ECR (public) rather than build it locally you can simply
remove the build stanza in the docker-compose.yml file to approach this file:

```
version: 3.7

services:
    gin:
        image: public.ecr.aws/w5v4j9k4/tsagroup_rupertbailey:latest
        container_name: gin
        restart: always
        ports:
            - "3004:3004"
```

then `podman-compose up --detach` will look to ecr-public for the image rather than building it.
Unfortunately there is no other way to override this behavior with a cli flag.
nor can you select another file to run podman-compose against.
