Hello Louiza and Laurie,

Please see attached the coding assignment for the interview on the 19th of July 2024

I have used the following projects as sources for my project:
* https://github.com/zeedt/go-docker-dev.to //for initial setup of the project
* https://github.com/dongri/phonenumber //for AU phone parsing for e164 formats
* https://github.com/go-pg/pg/v10 //Object Relational Mapping library for go

Pre requisites:
A linux CLI environment with `podman`, `podman-compose` and `curl` and active internet

Running project: bash ./doit.sh

podman-compose up -d #This will download and run the containers in the background: 
sleep 20 #you should wait a few seconds before using the API, I added 20 seconds
run_curl #this runs api commands
podman-compose down #this tears down the containers

this will to pull the image down from ECR (public) rather than build it locally you.
Otherwise you may build locally uncommenting the build stanza in the docker-compose.yml

```
version: 3.7

services:
    gin:
        image: public.ecr.aws/w5v4j9k4/tsagroup_rupertbailey:latest
        container_name: gin
        restart: always
        ports:
            - "3004:3004"
```
